We have two sons training under Mr. Black. One has been training since 2000 and the other since 2003. We are often asked why our children have continued in this program for so many years. Mr. Black has been a mentor and wonderful example of the tenets that he teaches. Mr. Black is a skilled and talented martial artist. He has a passion for what he teaches and a gift for bringing out the best in each individual student. Mr. Black has guided and encouraged our children to strive for their own personal best. We couldn’t think of a better sport, and more importantly, a better success coach to guide our children to reach their full potential.</p>

We enjoy the experience each time we attend class. My wife appreciates the self defense portion of class and my daughter loves the challenging aspects and the fun atmosphere of learning. I had a very athletic childhood. Becoming a student at Jeramy Black’s TaeKwonDo Academy has given me the opportunity to once again challenge myself physically, mentally, and competitively. Most of all, our family has come closer together through helping and motivating each other with this common interest. We love it, appreciate it, and look forward to continuing our TaeKwonDo journey.</p>

When I first began, I weighed over 300 pounds. Combined with physical activity, both inside and outside of class and a healthy diet, I have lost over 50 pounds and I am confident I will lose more and reach my goal weight. Additionally, attending the academy has given me the opportunity to meet many great people. I began TaeKwonDo as a hobby, and while it is still a great hobby, it has led me to increased health, higher self-esteem, a greater ability to protect myself in dangerous situations, and many friendships. The skills I have learned here have been beneficial to me in my physical and mental health and has given me additional tools and abilities that are useful to me in both personal and professional settings.</p>

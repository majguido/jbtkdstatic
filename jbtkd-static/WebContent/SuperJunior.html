									<p class="indent-bot">
										Students begin by learning the basic stances, blocks, strikes, kick, and escape skills. At each belt level, students are introduced to new material which builds off of previously learned techniques. Your child will have the opportunity to test for a new rank five times per year. This breaks down to five 10-12 week training cycles. Each week in the training cycle has a specific training theme. The weekly themes include targeting, power, competition, and many others. Students earn 4-5 curriculum stripes on each belt for learning specific techniques. The success of your child in our program is dependent on consistent training and focus on their goal to earn their TAEKWONDO BLACK BELT!

									<p class="indent-bot">
										Studies show that a good martial arts program can improve your child’s grades. 
										Consistent training twice a week allows children to get necessary exercise to not only stay healthy, 
										but also to “get their energy out” in order to focus better on school and homework. Here are a few 
										benefits from training in our TaeKwonDo classes:
									</p>
									<p class="indent-bot">
										<span style="display:inline;text-decoration:underline;" class="jbtkd-gold">
											Focus
										</span> - Whether a child is punching a pad or breaking a board, he or she must have a tremendous amount of focus in our classes.
									</p>
									<p class="indent-bot">
										<span style="display:inline;text-decoration:underline;" class="jbtkd-gold">
											Memorization
										</span> - Our program teaches forms (a series of moves that students memorize). These patterns require students to remember specific 
										techniques in a specific order. The memorization skills developed in martial arts can help children as they prepare for tests in school.
									</p>
									<p class="indent-bot">
										<span style="display:inline;text-decoration:underline;" class="jbtkd-gold">
											Discipline
										</span> - While our classes are high energy and motivating, they are also controlled and very focused on respectful behavior. Improved 
										behavior in TaeKwonDo class often translates into improved behavior at school. Improved behavior at school often translates into improved grades.
									</p>
									<p class="indent-bot">
										<span style="display:inline;text-decoration: underline;" class="jbtkd-gold">
										Goal setting
										</span> - There are many opportunities for goal setting in our classes. Leadership is the pillar of our curriculum- we put a high priority on 
										setting and sticking to goals. This teaches children to work toward the achievement of a goal.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<p class="indent-bot">
										We would love to offer your child a FREE trial class to make sure our academy is the right fit for your family and to ensure your child is 
										going to enjoy taking class. Call to schedule your FREE trial class today!!! We look forward to hearing from you and having the opportunity 
										to work with your child in the future!
